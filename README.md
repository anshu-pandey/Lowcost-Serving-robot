# Low Cost Serving Robot
We have build the cost of serving robot framework which will help us promote social distancing while serving food in resturant or hospital.
1. Customer will come to restuant and place the order through our app.
2. All details will be stored in the database.
3. Then chef will prepare the food 
4. Robot will go to that table and serve the food
5. Then we will collect the feedback and use that in data analysis
